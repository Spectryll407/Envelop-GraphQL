## Integrations and Examples

Envelop provides a low-level API at consumption of the output, but a rich API while using it with plugins. Based on that, it's possible to integrate Envelop with many tools.

We recommend using [`graphql-helix`](https://github.com/contrawork/graphql-helix) as the request pipeline orchestrator, as it allows the maximum flexibility and you can easily override/manage every part of the pipeline with Envelop.

### Compatiblity Table

Here's a list of integrations and examples:

| Lambda AWS             | Yes              | [`lambda-aws`](https://github.com/dotansimha/envelop/tree/main/examples/lambda-aws)                         |

> Since Envelop is not a HTTP server, and just a wrapper around GraphQL request pipeline - it's possible to integrate it with any server/framework, if it's flexible enough and allows you to specify the pipeline methods.
